const is used to declare a variable whose value cannot be reassigned once it has been initialized. 
This means that the variable will have a constant value throughout its lifetime.

Example:
const x = 5;
x = 10; // This will throw an error

let is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned later. 
This means that the value of the variable can change during its lifetime.

Example:
let x = 5;
x = 10; // This is allowed

var is also used to declare a variable that can be reassigned, but it has some differences compared to let. 
One main difference is that var has function scope, meaning that if it's declared inside a function, 
it's only accessible inside that function. On the other hand, let has block scope, 
meaning that if it's declared inside a block (e.g. inside a loop or an if statement), it's only accessible inside that block.

Example:
function foo() {
  var x = 5;
  if (true) {
    var y = 10;
    console.log(x); // This will log 5
  }
  console.log(y); // This will log 10
}
foo();
console.log(x); // This will throw an error because x is not defined outside of foo()
console.log(y); // This will throw an error because y is not defined outside of foo()
